This script enables broadcasting the installation of an APK to all Android devices connected to the computer. It's ideal for multiplayer setups and Quest 3 development with Unity3D.  

I have purchased 4 Quest headsets and 5 Android devices.  
Since I needed to develop a multiplayer game for all of them, I created some tools to streamline the process.  

Below, you'll find Python scripts to broadcast actions and retrieve files efficiently.
